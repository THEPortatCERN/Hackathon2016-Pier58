Sonification & Gamification of Physiotherapy

## SUMMARY:

Movement is key to healthy ageing and recovery from injuries or even pathologies. Physiotherapists and practitioners prescribe exercises that take the human body through certain movements, creating certain forces. Fundamental to the expected benefits of these exercises is their precise execution, easy under the watchful eye of the physiotherapist, but difficult when alone at home. Sonification can provide real-time audio feedback, with elements of feed-forward, that provides a quantitative reference for the correct execution of movements.
